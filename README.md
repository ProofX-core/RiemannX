# 🧠 RiemannX — Deterministic Verification Engine for the Riemann Hypothesis

> **A ProofX™ Core Engine**  
> Precision-grade infrastructure for zero-analysis, spectral verification, and large-scale computational experiments on the Riemann Hypothesis.

## 📘 Overview

**RiemannX** is a high-performance computational framework designed to **verify, analyze, and simulate** the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function with *deterministic reproducibility*.  
Built as part of the **ProofX Core Initiative**, it integrates mathematical rigor with system-level engineering—bridging **symbolic computation**, **distributed verification**, and **quantum-inspired analysis pipelines**.

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

- 🔍 **Zero Localization & Validation**  
  Implements high-precision contour-based zero finding with error-bounded confidence intervals.  
  Supports both classic zeta(s) and generalized L-functions.

- 🧮 **Spectral Analysis Framework**  
  Extracts statistical distributions of zeros (Δt, pair correlation, Montgomery–Odlyzko analysis).  
  Generates reproducible zero datasets in `.pxmf` (ProofX Manifest Format).

- ⚡ **Deterministic Computation Layer**  
  Byte-for-byte reproducibility via ProofX’s `ManifestEngine`.  
  Every run yields cryptographically hashed manifests for peer verification.

- 🧠 **Symbolic–Numeric Hybrid Core**  
  Combines `SymPy` for symbolic formulation with `NumPy` and `mpmath` for arbitrary-precision numerics.
