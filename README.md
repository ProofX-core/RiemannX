# RiemannX — Deterministic Verification Engine for the Riemann Hypothesis

> **A ProofX™ Core Engine**  
> Precision-grade infrastructure for zero-analysis, spectral verification, and large-scale computational experiments on the Riemann Hypothesis.

## Overview

**RiemannX** is a high-performance computational framework designed to **verify, analyze, and simulate** the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function with *deterministic reproducibility*.  
Built as part of the **ProofX Core Initiative**, it integrates mathematical rigor with system-level engineering—bridging **symbolic computation**, **distributed verification**, and **quantum-inspired analysis pipelines**.

## Core Capabilities

- **Zero Localization & Validation**  
  Implements high-precision contour-based zero finding with error-bounded confidence intervals.  
  Supports both classic zeta(s) and generalized L-functions.

- **Spectral Analysis Framework**  
  Extracts statistical distributions of zeros (Δt, pair correlation, Montgomery–Odlyzko analysis).  
  Generates reproducible zero datasets in `.pxmf` (ProofX Manifest Format).

- **Deterministic Computation Layer**  
  Byte-for-byte reproducibility via ProofX’s `ManifestEngine`.  
  Every run yields cryptographically hashed manifests for peer verification.
